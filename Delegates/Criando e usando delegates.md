Creating a simple demo banking ATM app is a great way to illustrate the concept of delegates in C#. Below, I’ll outline a use case for the ATM app that demonstrates how to declare, instantiate, and use a delegate. The example will involve creating a delegate for different banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

## Use Case: Banking Operations with Delegates

### Overview
In this demo, we will create a simple ATM application that allows users to perform banking operations. We will define a delegate that represents a method signature for these operations. The user can choose an operation, and the corresponding method will be invoked using the delegate.

### Step 1: Define the Delegate

First, we need to declare a delegate that will represent the banking operations.

```csharp
// Declare a delegate for banking operations
public delegate void BankingOperation(decimal amount);
```

### Step 2: Create the ATM Class

Next, we will create an `ATM` class that will contain methods for checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

```csharp
public class ATM
{
    private decimal balance;

    public ATM()
    {
        balance = 0; // Initial balance
    }

    // Method to check balance
    public void CheckBalance()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Current Balance: {balance:C}");
    }

    // Method to deposit money
    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        balance += amount;
        Console.WriteLine($"Deposited: {amount:C}. New Balance: {balance:C}");
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > balance)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Insufficient funds.");
        }
        else
        {
            balance -= amount;
            Console.WriteLine($"Withdrew: {amount:C}. New Balance: {balance:C}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Instantiate the Delegate

Now, we will instantiate the delegate and associate it with the methods in the `ATM` class.

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ATM atm = new ATM();

        // Instantiate the delegate
        BankingOperation operation;

        // Example usage
        operation = atm.Deposit;
        operation(100); // Deposit $100

        operation = atm.Withdraw;
        operation(50); // Withdraw $50

        operation = atm.CheckBalance;
        operation(0); // Check balance (amount is irrelevant)
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Running the Application

When you run the application, it will perform the following operations:

1. Deposit $100 to the account.
2. Withdraw $50 from the account.
3. Check the current balance.

### Complete Code Example

Here’s the complete code for the ATM application with delegates:

```csharp
using System;

public delegate void BankingOperation(decimal amount);

public class ATM
{
    private decimal balance;

    public ATM()
    {
        balance = 0; // Initial balance
    }

    public void CheckBalance()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Current Balance: {balance:C}");
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        balance += amount;
        Console.WriteLine($"Deposited: {amount:C}. New Balance: {balance:C}");
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > balance)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Insufficient funds.");
        }
        else
        {
            balance -= amount;
            Console.WriteLine($"Withdrew: {amount:C}. New Balance: {balance:C}");
        }
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ATM atm = new ATM();

        BankingOperation operation;

        operation = atm.Deposit;
        operation(100); // Deposit $100

        operation = atm.Withdraw;
        operation(50); // Withdraw $50

        operation = atm.CheckBalance;
        operation(0); // Check balance
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this video, you can explain how delegates work in C#, demonstrate how to declare and instantiate them, and show how they can be used to invoke different methods dynamically. This example provides a practical context for understanding delegates while also being engaging and relevant to the banking domain.
